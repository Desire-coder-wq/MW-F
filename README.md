## About
Mayondo is a multi-role login system built with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap 5), and JavaScript. It verifies users against predefined credentials and redirects them to role-specific dashboards. The project demonstrates core concepts in front-end form handling, validation, and navigation control.

## Features
- Role-based authentication (Admin, Manager, Attendant)
- User-friendly login interface with validation messages
- Automatic redirection to role-specific dashboards upon login
- Simple simulated user credential store (for demo purposes)

## Technologies
- HTML5 & CSS3
- Bootstrap 5.3
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the `index.html` (login page) in any modern browser.
3. No server setup is required since this is a front-end demo project.

## Usage
- Use the provided sample credentials from the login page to test each role:
- Admin: `admin` / `admin123`
- Manager: `manager1` / `manager123`
- Attendant: `attendant1` / `attendant123`
- Logging in with correct credentials will redirect you to the respective dashboard page.
- The project is designed to be a starting point for role-based applications and can be expanded to integrate backend verification.
